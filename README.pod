Passes if $thing's metaclass isa L<Moose::Meta::Role>.

=head2 is_class $thing

Passes if $thing's metaclass isa L<Moose::Meta::Class>.

=head2 check_sugar_removed_ok $thing

Ensures that all the standard Moose sugar is no longer directly callable on a
given package.

=head2 check_sugar_ok $thing

Checks and makes sure a class/etc can still do all the standard Moose sugar.
