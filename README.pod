=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package contains a number of additional tests that can be employed

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 known_sugar

Returns a list of all the known standard Moose sugar (has, extends, etc).

=head1 TEST_FUNCTIONS

=head2 meta_ok $thing

Tests $thing to see if it has a metaclass; $thing may be the class name or
instance of the class you wish to check.

=head2 does_ok $thing, < $role | \@roles >, [ $message ]

Checks to see if $thing does the given roles.  $thing may be the class name or
instance of the class you wish to check.

Note that the message will be taken verbatim unless it contains C<%s>
somewhere; this will be replaced with the name of the role being tested for.

=head2 has_method_ok $thing, @methods

Queries $thing's metaclass to see if $thing has the methods named in @methods.

=head2 is_role $thing

Passes if $thing's metaclass is a L<Moose::Meta::Role>.

=head2 is_class $thing

Passes if $thing's metaclass is a L<Moose::Meta::Class>.

=head2 check_sugar_removed_ok $thing

Ensures that all the standard Moose sugar is no longer directly callable on a
given package.

=head2 check_sugar_ok $thing

Checks and makes sure a class/etc can still do all the standard Moose sugar.

=head2 validate_class

validate_class 'Some::Class' => (

    attributes => [ ... ],
    methods    => [ ... ],
    isa        => [ ... ],
    does       => [ ... ],

);
