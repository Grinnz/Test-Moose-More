=head1 NAME

Test::Moose::More - More tools for testing Moose packages

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.012 of Test::Moose::More - released September 29, 2012 as part of Test-Moose-More.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Moose::More;

    is_class 'Some::Class';
    is_role  'Some::Role';
    has_method_ok 'Some::Class', 'foo';

    # ... etc

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package contains a number of additional tests that can be employed
against Moose classes/roles.  It is intended to replace L<Test::Moose> in your
tests, and reexports any tests that it has and we do not, yet.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 known_sugar

Returns a list of all the known standard Moose sugar (has, extends, etc).

=head1 TEST_FUNCTIONS

=head2 meta_ok $thing

Tests $thing to see if it has a metaclass; $thing may be the class name or
instance of the class you wish to check.

=head2 does_ok $thing, < $role | \@roles >, [ $message ]

Checks to see if $thing does the given roles.  $thing may be the class name or
instance of the class you wish to check.

Note that the message will be taken verbatim unless it contains C<%s>
somewhere; this will be replaced with the name of the role being tested for.

=head2 does_not_ok $thing, < $role | \@roles >, [ $message ]

Checks to see if $thing does not do the given roles.  $thing may be the class
name or instance of the class you wish to check.

Note that the message will be taken verbatim unless it contains C<%s>
somewhere; this will be replaced with the name of the role being tested for.

=head2 has_attribute_ok $thing, $attribute_name, [ $message ]

Checks C<$thing> for an attribute named C<$attribute_name>; C<$thing> may be a
class name, instance, or role name.

=head2 has_method_ok $thing, @methods

Queries $thing's metaclass to see if $thing has the methods named in @methods.

=head2 requires_method_ok $thing, @methods

Queries $thing's metaclass to see if $thing requires the methods named in
@methods.

Note that this really only makes sense if $thing is a role.

=head2 is_role $thing

Passes if $thing's metaclass is a L<Moose::Meta::Role>.

=head2 is_class $thing

Passes if $thing's metaclass is a L<Moose::Meta::Class>.

=head2 check_sugar_removed_ok $thing

Ensures that all the standard Moose sugar is no longer directly callable on a
given package.

=head2 check_sugar_ok $thing

Checks and makes sure a class/etc can still do all the standard Moose sugar.

=head2 validate_thing

Runs a bunch of tests against the given C<$thing>, as defined:

    validate_class $thing => (

        attributes => [ ... ],
        methods    => [ ... ],
        isa        => [ ... ],

        # ensures $thing does these roles
        does       => [ ... ],

        # ensures $thing does not do these roles
        does_not   => [ ... ],
    );

C<$thing> can be the name of a role or class, an object instance, or a
metaclass.

=head2 validate_role

The same as validate_thing(), but ensures C<$thing> is a role, and allows for
additional role-specific tests.

    validate_role $thing => (

        required_methods => [ ... ],

        # ...and all other options from validate_thing()

=head2 validate_class

The same as validate_thing(), but ensures C<$thing> is a class, and allows for
additional class-specific tests.

=head2 validate_attribute

Run checks against an attribute.  Not yet documented or tested exhaustively.
